Push Swap is a program designed to sort a stack of integers using a minimal number of operations. The goal is to arrange the stack in ascending order, with the smallest number at the top.

To use Push Swap, execute the program with the stack a formatted as a list of integers, where the first argument represents the top of the stack. For example:
<pre>

$> ./push_swap 4 2 7 1
</pre>

Push Swap provides informative error messages in case of incorrect usage or invalid input parameters. If an error occurs, the program will display "Error" followed by a newline character (\n) on the standard error.

The project includes a Makefile that compiles the source files without relinking.

Global variables are not used in the program, adhering to the project requirements.
